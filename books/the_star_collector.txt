Milo believed he could collect stars. Each night, he climbed the hill behind his house with a tiny glass jar.

He reached up and tried to catch the shimmering lights, but they were always just beyond his fingers. “Maybe tomorrow,” he would say.

One night, an old traveler met him on the hill. “Why do you chase the stars?” the traveler asked.

“I want to keep their light,” Milo replied.

The traveler smiled. “The stars are not meant to be kept. They are meant to guide.”

Milo looked at the sky again. He realized the stars were already giving him something — wonder. He left the jar behind and walked home, feeling brighter inside than any jar could hold.
