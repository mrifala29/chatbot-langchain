In a quiet town stood a tall golden clock tower. It had kept perfect time for many years — until one day, it forgot how.

The clock’s hands froze at midnight. The townspeople grew confused. “Is it always night now?” they wondered.

Inside the tower, the clock felt ashamed. “What am I without time?” it asked itself.

A small sparrow landed on one of its hands. “You are still here,” she chirped. “Time may stop, but you still stand tall.”

Listening to the sparrow, the clock realized that its worth was not only in ticking, but in being a steady presence.

With renewed courage, the clock’s gears slowly began to move again. And even when it ticked imperfectly, the town loved it just the same.
