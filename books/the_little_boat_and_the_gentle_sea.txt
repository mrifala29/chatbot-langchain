A tiny wooden boat floated near the shore. It had never traveled far and was afraid of the deep blue sea.

“What if the waves are too big?” the boat whispered.

The Sea responded softly, “I will not push you further than you can go.”

One calm evening, the boat allowed the waves to carry it just a little farther than before. It trembled at first, but the Sea remained gentle.

The boat discovered something wonderful — the horizon was not frightening. It was peaceful.

From that day on, the little boat understood that courage does not mean sailing far. Sometimes, it simply means drifting a little beyond fear.
