Oliver the owl loved to talk. He hooted stories to the trees, the river, and even the wind. But one evening, the forest felt unusually quiet.

“No one is listening,” Oliver sighed. He tried louder hoots, but the silence only grew thicker.

Feeling lonely, Oliver flew to the oldest oak tree. The tree gently rustled its leaves and said, “Sometimes, quiet does not mean absence. It means listening.”

Oliver sat still for the first time in his life. In the silence, he heard the soft breathing of deer, the gentle trickle of water, and the whisper of stars above.

The forest had never been empty. It had simply been waiting for him to listen.

From that night on, Oliver learned that peace can be found not in speaking — but in stillness.
