The Moon used to shine brighter than any star in the sky. Every night, children would look up and smile at its gentle silver light. But one evening, the Moon felt tired. It wondered if anyone truly needed its glow anymore.

Clouds drifted by and whispered, “You look dim tonight.” The Moon felt embarrassed and tried to hide behind them. Below, the world seemed quieter without its comforting shine.

In a small house at the edge of a forest, a little girl named Lila looked out her window. “Where is the Moon?” she asked softly. She could not fall asleep without its light resting on her pillow.

Hearing this, the Moon peeked through the clouds. It realized that even a small glow could guide someone in the dark. Slowly, it began to shine again — not brighter than before, but warmer.

That night, Lila slept peacefully, and the Moon understood something important: sometimes, being needed by even one heart is more than enough.
